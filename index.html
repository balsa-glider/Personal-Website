                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Accelerate and lift off in ground effect at the lowest possible flying speed. Accelerate to normal climb speed in ground effect, then climb to 1000 feet AGL while correcting for crosswind and maintaining the desired airspeed profile.</p>

                <h3>Normal Approach and Landing</h3>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>From a stabilized descent toward a selected aiming point, reduce power as necessary and raise pitch
                    attitude to touch down at a selected point. Maintain position over and alignment with the runway
                    centerline.</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Stabilize approach path and airspeed on extended runway centerline—pitch for aiming point, power
                        for airspeed. Flaps full.</li>
                    <li>Crossing the threshold, begin pitching up and reducing power simultaneously. Achieve touchdown
                        pitch attitude and idle power about 1 foot above the runway.</li>
                    <li>Use rudder to align with runway and bank angle to maintain position over centerline in the
                        presence of crosswind.</li>
                    <li>Raise nose slightly to arrest sink rate as necessary, but don’t allow nose to get so high that
                        it blocks sight of the runway.</li>
                    <li>Maintain backpressure and increase aileron to full into the wind after touchdown.</li>
                    <li>While slowing, brake as necessary and focus on maintaining control of aircraft.</li>
